#	Makefile for the project skeleton.
#
#	This Makefile is the human-facing driver.
#	Each rule calls the appropriate tool instead of reimplementing work:
#		build:  sh scripts/site-build.sh
#		site:   sh scripts/site-build.sh + sh scripts/site-condense.sh
#		        (the standard page set; see prompts/features/02-project-pages.md)
#		clean:  rm generated output
#		test:   npm test
#		deploy: RETIRED - all publishing to labs.bannister.us goes through
#		        the homelab project (homelab-publish; see the homelab's
#		        documents/09-project-pages-conventions.md). This target
#		        only reminds you of that; use the homelab's make deploy.
#		install: reserved; not yet defined.
